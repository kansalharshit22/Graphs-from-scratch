# Graph Algorithms – Learning Repo

This repository contains my journey of learning Graph Data Structures and Algorithms.  
I will upload base code, patterns, and problem solutions.

## Folders

### `traversal/`
Contains BFS and DFS implementations.

## Topics I will add later
- Connected components  
- Cycle detection  
- Topological sort  
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, Bellman-Ford)  
- MST (Kruskal, Prim)  
- etc.
